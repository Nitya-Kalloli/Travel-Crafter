Welcome to TravelCrafter! This project offers essential features allowing users to register, create property listings, and rate other users' listings. The application employs Mapbox to showcase precise locations, MongoDB for efficient data storage, and Cloudinary for storing images.

## Features 🚀

1. **User Authentication**
   - Users can sign up and log in to the platform.
   - Sessions are managed with signed cookies for secure authentication.

2. **Listing Creation**
   - Registered users can create listings for properties they want to rent or share.
   - Each listing includes essential details like property description, amenities, and location.

3. **Listing Rating**
   - Users can rate and review listings based on their experiences.
   - Ratings contribute to the overall reputation of the listing.

4. **Mapbox Integration**
   - Utilizes Mapbox to display the precise location of each listing on an interactive map.
   - Enhances user experience by providing visual context to the property's surroundings.

5. **Image Storage on Cloudinary**
   - Images associated with listings are securely stored on Cloudinary.
   - Cloudinary serves as a reliable cloud service for managing and delivering images.

6. **MVC Framework**
   - The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern for organized and scalable development.
